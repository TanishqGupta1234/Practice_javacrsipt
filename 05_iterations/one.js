// for loop
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}
// Notes for for loop:
// 1. The for loop is used to iterate over a block of code a number of times.
// 2. The syntax is: for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) { code to be executed }
// 3. The initialization is executed once before the loop starts.
// 4. The condition is evaluated before each iteration, and if it evaluates to true, the loop continues.
// 5. The increment/decrement is executed after each iteration.
// 6. The loop will stop when the condition evaluates to false.
// 7. It is commonly used when the number of iterations is known beforehand.
