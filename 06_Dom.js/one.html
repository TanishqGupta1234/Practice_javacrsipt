<!-- DOM (Document Object Model) in JavaScript is a way to represent
     the structure of a web page so that JavaScript can access, 
     change, or delete elements like text, images, or buttons. -->

     <!-- DOM is the bridge between HTML and JavaScript. It turns your web page into a tree-like structure that JavaScript can interact with. -->
